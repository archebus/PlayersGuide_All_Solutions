# C# Player's Guide - Solutions

Welcome to the repository where I am solving all the exercises from the *C# Player's Guide* using a terminal-only workflow. This repo contains my solutions to each problem in the book.

## Workflow

The goal of this project is to practice a **new workflow** to solidify my development skills. I am solving all problems blind (without reference to past solutions) using the following tools:

- **Vim** for editing code
- **.NET CLI** for building, running, and testing C# projects
- **Git** for version control

My goals is to enhance my development skills by removing as many handholds as possible.

### Why This Workflow?

- **Minimalist setup**: The goal is to focus on code, using only the terminal with no heavy IDE overhead.

- **Improving keyboard-based development**: I want to develop my keyboard-driven coding abilities. I am hoping this irons out gaps in my coding abilities and enhances workflow across the board.

- **Streamlining Git workflows**: I use Git entirely from the terminal to manage version control, pushing all solutions to this public repository as I progress.

- **.NET CLI mastery**: I use the .NET command-line tools (`dotnet`) to build and run my C# projects, ensuring that I rely on the command line for compiling and executing the code. No IDE's allowed whatsoever.

- **Limited Outside Help**: No use of AI, autocomplete etc. allowed. I plan to only reference "Learn Microsoft" if I get stuck along the way.
